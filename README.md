# Discord "Pidor" Bot

Welcome to the Discord "Pidor" Bot! This Node.js-based bot adds a playful and random element to your Discord server by selecting a user at regular intervals and assigning them the "Pidor" role. Users can be exempted from being selected, and there are additional commands for checking the top users, voting, and more.

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token

```

- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token.
- `DATABASE_URL`: URL for the database storage.

## Commands
